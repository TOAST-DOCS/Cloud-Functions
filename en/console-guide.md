<br>

> **[Note]** <br> The Deploy button is only used to check the build of the source code you created, and when you create a function, it will be rebuilt with the latest source code, not the build you tested with Deploy.

### Modify functions
To modify the function settings and code of an existing function, use the Edit button to modify the function.
#### Non-modifiable item
- Name, runtime environment
    - You can edit everything except the item.
#### Source code
- If you're using the code editor, the existing code is loaded.
- If you created a function by uploading a ZIP file from the local environment, when you switch to the code editor, it loads the default template code without showing the ZIP file.

### Delete a function
![console-guide-14](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_cloud_functions/2025-07-29/console-guide-14.png)
Select an existing function to delete it. You can delete multiple functions at once.

### Copy a function
![console-guide-13](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_cloud_functions/2025-07-29/console-guide-13.png)
Copy a function that is identical to an existing function. The name cannot be duplicated, so you can rewrite the name before copying.
- Triggers are not copied. (HTTP triggers are provided by default).

## About functions
### List of functions
![console-guide-01](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_cloud_functions/2025-07-29/console-guide-01.png)
- You can see a list of functions that users have created.
- The build status is automatically updated to confirm that the function is available.
### Basic information of functions
![console-guide-02](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_cloud_functions/2025-07-29/console-guide-02.png)
- You can see basic information about the function.
- You can check the logs by going to Log & Crash Search service via the Log & Crash Search button in the log management topic.
- You can check the build log by clicking the “Check build log” button in the build status item.
- You can download the code you wrote as a ZIP file.
### Manage function triggers
You can manage triggers that can perform functions. HTTP triggers are built-in.

![console-guid-12](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_cloud_functions/2025-07-29/console-guide-12.png)

- You can execute the function you created via a given HTTP trigger.
    - Example: `https://{userdomain}/{function name}`
    - Method : GET, POST

#### Create/edit triggers
- Timer
    - Value: Enter the cycle as a Cron string.
#### Delete triggers
- You can select multiple triggers to delete. You can't delete the HTTP trigger, which is the default trigger.

> **[Note]**
> <br>Currently, we only support Timer triggers.
### Monitor functions
![console-guide-06](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_cloud_functions/2025-07-29/console-guide-06.png)
- You can check the usage of a function.
- Provide metrics for the number of function calls, number of call rejections, number of errors, success rate, and function execution time.
- Provide metrics within a set time.
- If logs are integrated, you can navigate to the Log & Crash Search service using the Log & Crash Search button.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of function calls | Total number of function calls (per second) |
| Number of call rejections | Number of function calls that failed as instances were not created (per second) |
| Number of errors | Number of responses with a non-200 response code (per second) |
| Success rate | Ratio of successful calls to the total number of function calls |
| Function execution time | Response time for function calls |

> **[Note]**
> <br>The number of call rejections is only relevant if the type is Pool Manager.
> <br>The number of function calls, call rejections, and errors are displayed as an average number of times per second within the range of the metric step. For example, if the step is 15 seconds and 1 event occurred within the time period, it is displayed as 0.0667 (1÷15).
> <br>The average of the function execution time is the overall cumulative average, and the maximum is the maximum execution time during the period.
